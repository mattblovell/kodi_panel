#
#[CODECS]



# Colors
#
#   Specify color names to use elsewhere.  To know whether this
#   dictionary needs to be consulted, all names MUST begin with
#   "color_".  Color references without those initial characters just
#   get passed through, without a lookup in this dictionary.

# Font list
#
#   These entries create an array that kodi_panel processes at startup
#   time, pulling the fonts into Pillow.  The font name that is
#   assigned must match those that get used further below in the

#   A "font_main" MUST be defined and successfully loaded!
#

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Shared Elements
#
#   The intent of the shared_element table (which becomes a dictionary
#   in Python) is to define display elements that can be used by
#   multiple layouts.
#
#   The details of each entry must correspond to what one would
#   normally populate within a layout (e.g., a textfield needs a name,
#   posx, posy, font, fill, etc).
#
#   With any layout that desired to use such an element, one
#   references it by the name (key) given to it within the
#   shared_element table.  For instance, defining a shared progress
#   bar and elapsed time display could be done as follows:
#
#     [shared_element.elapsed_time]
#      name = "MusicPlayer.Time"
#      posx = 420
#      posy = 36
#      font = "font7S"
#      fill = "color_7S"
#      dynamic = 1
#
#     [shared_element.progress_bar]
#      posx   = 420
#      posy   = 8
#      height = 12
#      short_len = 196
#      long_len  = 300
#      color_fg = "color_7S"
#      color_bg = "color_gray"
#
#   Given the above definitions, a layout can then include a shared
#   element by refering to it by name (with no other keys listed).
#   Here is an example, which includes one normal directly-specified
#   element.
#
#     [A_LAYOUT.A_FULLSCREEN.thumb]
#     center = 1
#     size = 480
#
#     [A_LAYOUT.A_FULLSCREEN.prog]
#      shared_element = "progress_bar"
#
#     [[A_LAYOUT.A_FULLSCREEN.fields]]
#      shared_element = "elapsed_time"
#
#
# [shared_element.replace_name]
#



# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Audio Screens
#
#   This data structure gets used by audio_screens() to control the
#   layout and contents of any audio information screens.  Content can
#   be omitted from a screen just by commenting it out here, particular
#   for text fields.
#
#   Entries within the "fields" array generally correspond to text
#   fields, but the introduction of the ELEMENT_CB lookup table (if
#   customized) does permit for additional graphical elements.  Such
#   customization does require a bit of Python programming.
#
#   Note that the available InfoLabels can be augmented via use of
#   the AUDIO_LABELS list (see earlier in this file).  The same
#   is true for InfoBooleans.
#
#   All entries in the "fields" array" MUST have a name (either
#   specified explicitly or inherited from a shared element
#   reference).  The 'name' key corresponds to ONE of the following:
#
#     - An exact match for one of the InfoLabels or Booleans retrieved
#       from Kodi.  The entry is only rendered if the corresponding
#       InfoLabel is non-empty.
#
#     - An exact match for one of the callback functions named in the
#       ELEMENT_CB table or the STRING_CB table.  That match triggers
#       execution of the corresponding callback function.
#
#     - An arbitrary string (not matching an InfoLabels or Booleans or
#       any callback function names), provided that the entry ALSO
#       specifies a 'format_str' key.  The interpolated format_str
#       always gets rendered.
#
#   The execution path followed by any of the above naming choices is
#   typically expected to yield a text string to display.  Remaining
#   keys that control the rendering of that text are as follows:
#
#      posx     X-coordinate for display (horizontal position)
#      posy     Y-coordinate for display (vertical position)
#      font     Font to use for rendering
#      fill     Text color
#
#      dynamic  A boolean flag to true/1 to indicate that the
#               field should be considered dynamic, re-drawn
#               upon every update loop.
#
#      prefix   Optional string ahead of InfoLabel text
#      suffix   Optional string following InfoLabel text
#
#      format_str Alternatively, rather than using prefix and suffix,
#                 and if one is NOT triggering a callback function, a
#                 formatting string can be specified.  The string
#                 should contain one or more InfoLabels to substitute,
#                 enclosed within curly braces.  See the status layout
#                 screen text fields for examples.
#
#                 Terms to be substituted can also make use of any
#                 entries defined within the string-manipulation
#                 callback table (see the STRING_CB dictionary in
#                 kodi_panel_display.py)
#
#      trunc    Flag indicating that single line string should
#               truncated at the right-hand edge of the display
#
#      wrap     Flag indication that the string should be wrapped.
#               When wrapping, further information is needed...
#
#      max_width  Maximum horizontal width string can occupy
#      max_lines  Maximum number of lines to occupy; additional
#                 text gets truncated on the final line
#
#      label    Separate text to display, with an independent
#               font and independent fill color, when the InfoLabel
#               is non-empty.  Labels require several additional
#               keys, all of which start with "l".  These are
#               still keys at the same level in the field's
#               dictionary.
#
#      lposx    Horizontal position for label string
#      lpoxy    Vertical position for label string
#      lfont    Font for label string
#      lfill    Font fill color for label string
#
#      exclude  A string or an array strings that, if the text to
#               be displayed exactly matches, causes the element to
#               not be drawn.
#
#      display_if / display_ifnot
#               An alternative mechanism for controlling element
#               display.  The value must be a two-element list
#               providing two strings.
#
#               The first string must be either an InfoLabel or a
#               string callback function (entry in STRING_CB).
#
#               The second string is then compared for equality (or
#               inequality, when using ifnot) against the string
#               resulting from "evaluating" the InfoLabel or callback
#               function.
#
#               Examples:
#
#                 display_if = [ "MusicPlayer.TrackNumber", "02" ]
#                 display_if = [ "Player.Paused", "true" ]
#
#
#   Internal callbacks are used for the 'codec' and 'artist' text
#   fields.  End-user scripts are free to augment or modify the
#   callback tables (look for ELEMENT_CB and STRING_CB).
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Background
#
#   Every layout, including the status screens, can optional specify a
#   background entry at the top-level.  A few examples are as follows:
#
#     [A_LAYOUT.A_FULLSCREEN.background]
#      fill = "navy"        # uniform fill color
#
#   or
#
#     [A_LAYOUT.A_FULLSCREEN.background]
#      rectangle = 1        # rectangle with frame/border
#      fill = "navy"
#      outline = "yellow"
#      width = 3
#
#   or
#
#     [STATUS_LAYOUT.background]
#      image = "images/mickey-sprite.png"   # assumed sized correctly
#
#
#   As shown, the entry must be named "background".
