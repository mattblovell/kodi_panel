#   Odroid C4:  GPIO19 (physical Pin 35)
#   RPi 3:      GPIO16 (physical Pin 36)

# The USE_BACKLIGHT boolean controls whether calls are made to

# Audio Screens
#
#   This data structure gets used by audio_screens() to control the
#   layout and contents of any audio information screens.  Content can
#   be omitted from a screen just by commenting it out here, particular
#   for text fields.
#
#   Top-level entries within this A_LAYOUT table MUST have names that
#   correspond to the ALAYOUT_NAMES list specified earlier in this
#   file.
#
#   If a completely new InfoLabel is desired, then one must also
#   augment the AUDIO_LABELS list (see earlier in this file).
#
#   All entries within the "fields" array below correspond to text
#   fields, with the 'name' key generally corresponding to one of the
#   retrieved InfoLabels.  Each entry is a little dictionary that can
#   specify the following entries:
#
#      posx     X-coordinate for field (horizontal position)
#      posy     Y-coordinate for field (vertical position)
#      font     Font to use for rendering
#      fill     Text color
#
#      dynamic  A boolean flag to true/1 to indicate that the
#               field should be considered dynamic, re-drawn
#               upon every update loop.
#
#      prefix   Optional string ahead of InfoLabel text
#      suffix   Optional string following InfoLabel text
#
#      format_str Alternatively, rather than using prefix and suffix,
#                 one has the option of using a format_str.  The
#                 string should contain one or more InfoLabels to
#                 substitute, enclosed within curly braces.  See the
#                 status layout screen text fields for examples.
#
#      trunc    Flag indicating that single line string should
#               truncated at the right-hand edge of the display
#
#      wrap     Flag indication that the string should be wrapped.
#               When wrapping, further information is needed...
#
#      max_width  Maximum horizontal width string can occupy
#      max_lines  Maximum number of lines to occupy; additional
#                 text gets truncated on the final line
#
#      label    Separate text to display, with an independent
#               font and independent fill color, when the InfoLabel
#               is non-empty.  Labels require several additional
#               keys, all of which start with "l".  These are
#               still keys at the same level in the field's
#               dictionary.
#
#      lposx    Horizontal position for label string
#      lpoxy    Vertical position for label string
#      lfont    Font for label string
#      lfill    Font fill color for label string
#
#
#   Special treatment exists for the 'codec' and 'artist' text fields.
